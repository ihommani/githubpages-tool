Summary: Why ranger is worth to try ?


I have used ranger for two years. I said "used" but i'd rather say "underused".
The good thing about writting a blog is that you have to dig things up, for the sake of your own credibility.
At that point i trully think you should give a chance to ranger. At least to test another paradigm of file manager.
So, is Ranger a true alternative to classic file managers ?
As always, the right response would be "It depends.".
Ranger has strong requirements. And the step could be too high for some people.
Moreover it has some drawbacks I'm still guessing how to adress it.


#Ranger ?
So basically Ranger is a file manager with an ncurse interface. 
It allows to do the basic CRUD operations on you file system.
What appeals me in Ranger, is how you can tweak it to closely match your needs.
Moreover things can be blazingly fast with ranger as you only manipulate it through your keyboard.

And that is the first step to address for someone used to GUI.
No more Mr.Shinny features. All you have is a bunch of columns and lines.
Yet the all things is clear enough to get things right as you can see in the below pictures.
But the advantage of not relying on graphic servor are numerous.
First, you don't need to start a graphic servor, i.e ranger is usable in the console.
Second, you save a plenty of resources. For instance on my 3Go RAM computer (pretty low in the time writting this article) the memory print wouldn't go over 0.5%. So it is for the CPU comsumption.

# All the power in the tips of your fingers
The second steps to address is to accept the fact you won't need a mouse.
In a way it's weirdly said. Can we conplain if we need no more something ?
Concernig the mouse I think there is some kind of addiction. We can't (or don't want to) see alternative, either when mouse is not the best mean.
Think a second of the time you spend doing the triptic {searching; moving; clicking}
Wouldn't be better to replace it by 1, 2 or three keystrokes ?

Don't get me wrong, mouse is useful for many usecases and without alternative in some case(Gaming, drawing).
But I think that there is better alternative in the case of file manager, and mouse is no match for the speed of the keyboard...in the case you 
master the type touching i.e typing without watching your keyboard.
That is the second part of the step. You have to invest yourself in mastering your keyboard. 
And believe me in a month or two you'll thank me.

Ranger has some killer features which in my point of view allow it to surpass its graphic counterpart.
Still it has some drawbacks
Some are obvious. Other less, and ask to dig a little bit deeper.
But before talking about all the possibilities it offers, let's talk about the one which made me adopt Ranger.
